## about e-fun

E-fun is a fractal inspired, parent-child orbiting, zoomable, and minimalistic content management assistant. A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. Its usual application is building web sites. Composing content in E-fun is consisted of importing graphics from external vector image or bitmap editor, and arranging it within ovals using parent-children structure described in a separate file. Because E-fun treats individual pages as graphics, designers have complete freedom in composing content. Vector graphic pages are suitable for expressing textual content and illustrations, while bitmap pages are suitable for expressing photos.

## user experience

As much as E-fun makes the final result attractive and distinctive from mainstream products, on the other side, it offers a slackware flat-file experience for creating sites. This means that, besides creating and saving pages in external graphic editing tools, one has to possess a knowledge about editing the main contents JSON file in a text editor, as well as setting up a local web server for testing the site before publishing. Once that site is done, the files of which the site is composed of are ready to be uploaded to a remote server. All this may require some degree of technical knowledge from web authors, but once one gets into the stunt, maintaining web sites with E-fun should be an easy-peasy task.

## target audience

E-fun is made as a helper to organize, emphasize, and publish your web pages. E-fun offers a distinctive, progressive, and adventurous way to present your content. E-fun can bring your insights, messages, and ideas to be shared, seen, and accented in an original way, but it requires an open mind, a bit of experience, and a courage to stand out. If you find yourself between these lines, be sure to check E-fun out.
