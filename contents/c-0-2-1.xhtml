            -fun implements a real time magnifyer rendering effect for displaying content that is larger than
            display area. The center of oval area uses a magnification factor of 1, the border area uses a
            magnification factor of 0, while the space in between uses a fine range between those two. Such
            content is no longer required to use scroll bars to focus an area of interest, yet the entire
            content image pane fits in an oval with a combined range of different magnification factors. User
            is always free to pan and focus any area of content by dragging it to the center of an oval.
            However, note that only the central oval accepts the panning events.
