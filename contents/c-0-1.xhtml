            -fun is optimized to visualize and navigate relatively small number of content elements
            (up to some 30 separate page units, varying on page sizes and client performance). Since
            E-fun visual interface is very processing intensive, all the graphical elements are
            pre-cached upon loading page system. Pre-caching is used to deliver smooth and
            flicker-free browsing experience as much as it is possible, but it may also introduce
            an initial startup delay on slower machines if using a larger number of image elements.
