            he latest version of Fract-exp loads content elements on demand, thus it is scalable as
            long as we have enough RAM on disposition. That means that we should be able to successfuly
            cope with at least a half a thousand pages per gigabyte of RAM.

            However, Fract-exp is able to display only static content pages, meaning it is suited only
            for displaying static web sites. This limitation entails no fancy animations or dynamic
            content structure. Still, Fract-exp could be used in a various scenarios where static contents
            meets our expectations.
