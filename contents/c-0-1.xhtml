            he latest version of Fract-exp loads content element pages on display demand, thus it is
            scalable as long as we have enough RAM at disposition. We should be able to successfuly cope
            with at least a half a thousand pages per gigabyte of RAM.

            However, Fract-exp is able to display only static content pages. This limitation entails having
            no fancy animations or dynamic content structure. Still, Fract-exp could be used in a various
            scenarios where static contents meet our expectations.
