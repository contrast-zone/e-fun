            hese pages are created with E-fun, and they contain E-fun use and site building instructions. The current
            version of E-fun represents an innovative, headless, flat-file, and light content management system.
            Content management system (CMS) is a software application that manage the creation and modification of
            digital content. When using E-fun, content pages are supposed to be collected from outer resources such as
            bitmap, vector, and HTML editors, while E-fun itself manages only tree structuring and browsing the
            contents. Supported content pages include static HTML, XHTML, SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPG files.

            When creating an E-fun based site, one should be sure to prepare for a "slack" experience. This means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing html pages and bitmap or vector graphics, usage of
            local file system, managing local web server, and uploading files to a remote web server. Nevertheless,
            once one gets into the stunt, maintaining the site should be an easy-peasy task.
