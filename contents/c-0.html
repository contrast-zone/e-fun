            hese pages are created in E-fun, and they contain E-fun use instructions. The current version of E-fun
            represents an innovative, headless, flat-file, and light content management system. Content management
            system (CMS) is a software application that manage the creation and modification of digital content.
            Using E-fun, the content pages are supposed to be collected from outer resources such as image and HTML
            editors, while E-fun itself manages only tree structuring and browsing the contents. Supported content
            pages include static HTML, XHTML, SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPEG files.

            For creating an E-fun based site, one should make sure to prepare for a "slack" experience. This means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing html pages and bitmap or vector graphics, usage of
            local file system, managing local web server, and uploading files to a remote web server. Nevertheless,
            once one gets into the stunt, maintaining the site should be an easy-peasy task.
