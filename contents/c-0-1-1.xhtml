            lthough E-fun use is questionable for bigger projects for performance reasons, there is a
            chance that some smaller projects could be powered by E-fun. So, what can fit in less than
            30 pages web site? Let's overview a few examples:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> personal or business portfolio </li>
                <li> notice board </li>
                <li> items catalogue </li>
                <li> happenings schedule </li>
                <li> presentation slide show </li>
                <li> ... </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the list goes on, a hope emerges that e-fun could still find a use in various cases.
