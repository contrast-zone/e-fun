            lthough E-fun use is questionable for bigger projects for performance reasons, there is a
            chance that some smaller projects could be powered by E-fun. So, what can fit in less than
            30 pages web site? Let's overview a few examples:
            
            <ul>
            <li> personal or business portfolio </li>
            <li> notice board </li>
            <li> items catalogue </li>
            <li> happenings schedule </li>
            <li> presentation slide show </li>
            <li> ... </li>
            </ul>

            As the list goes on, a hope emerges that e-fun could still find a use in various cases. But for
            creating an E-fun based site, one should make sure to prepare to a "slack" experience. That means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing html pages and bitmap graphics, usage of local
            file system, managing local web server, and uploading files to a remote web server.. Nevertheless,
            once you get into the stunt, maintaining the site should be an easy-peasy task.
