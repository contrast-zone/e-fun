            inally, when we are done testing our site, we would want to publish it to a remote online server. To do
            this, we have to copy the entire structure from below the e-fun-home-folder, to the remote online server
            home folder. We can usually do this by using control panel pages provided by the remote server, or using
            an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP client software</a> if we have an
            access to remote site FTP user name and password. If everything goes well, our new web site should be
            happily spinning on the web.
